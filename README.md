# Solve-Polynomial-Equations

A C++ program to solve polynomial equations of various degrees. This project provides functionality to input polynomial coefficients and computes the real roots of the equation.

## Features

- Solve linear, quadratic, and higher-degree polynomial equations.
- Command-line interface for entering coefficients.
- Handles real roots (expand to complex roots if needed).
- Clear and modular C++ code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Git

### Building

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyaanKhan1576/Solve-Polynomial-Equations.git
cd Solve-Polynomial-Equations
```

Compile the code (update `main.cpp` to your actual main file name if different):
```bash
g++ -o solve main.cpp
```

### Running

Run the program:
```bash
./solve
```
